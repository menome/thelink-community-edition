## Overview 

Experience is the best teacher.

Every project your company does, every task a person undertakes as they work to bring a project to life, contains valuable insight and lessons as to how to do things better.

This valuable experience forms the foundation of your organization’s knowledge. The challenge is that the lessons people learn as they do their work ends up being scattered across disconnected, difficult to use systems: thus these valuable lessons are often lost.

Menome Technologies Knowledge Discovery Platform –>theLink<– will help capture and retain those valuable lessons learned and bring them together so that they can be shared by all employees.

By connecting data and knowledge from the systems and documents your company uses using descriptions and terms your people are familiar with, –->theLink<–- makes it simple for those lessons to be shared and accessed by everyone in your organization, so that they can deliver the best possible project to your clients in the least amount of time, every time.

Our goal is to help you give your employees one place to go to easily access the experience your organization possesses to ensure everyone has the shortest distance between a question and the knowledge required to answer it.
