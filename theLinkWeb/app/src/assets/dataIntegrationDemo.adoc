== Introduction

Alberta provides well and facility report data: A basic model of this is shown below:

The source files for this graph are derived from the Alberta Energy Regulator website: https://www.aer.ca/data-and-publications/statistical-reports/st37

They are also provided in -->theLink<-- : community edition : docker container. A downloadable base graph database is available here: 

== Setup

Some basic pre-processing was required to get the files into an importable state:
(describe): 

Otherwise, you can download the database directly, unzip it and replace the graph.db folder with the contents. 


== EXTRACT DATA TO NEW NODE: Using the graph to parse data out of nodes into new nodes

One of the advantages of the graph database over SQL databases, is that it is very easy to refactor graphs. 

Because the graph is flexible and fluid, it is possible to use graph tools via cypher to create new relationships as they are needed or identified
quickly. 

In this case, the base graph has no specific information about chemistry assocaited with wells, because the source files don't call those data as a seperate file. The data
do exist however in the EDCT file: 
EDCT 
11	Gas Frac Plant <0.01	Gas fractionating plant - Facilities< 0.01 mol/kmol H2Sin inlet stream

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(:Person)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(fof:Person)
RETURN fof.name as fof, count(*) as frequency
----

//table

== REPLACEME: SECOND USE-CASE TITLE

// REMOVEME: Describe what this use-case is solving and how the query represents that

// REMOVEME: A Cypher query to with graph output

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path=(a:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(:Person)-[:FRIENDS_WITH]-(fof:Person)
RETURN path, a, fof
----

//graph_result

////
// You can also use both graph_result and then table if you return full nodes, relationships or paths
////

== REPLACEME: THIRD USE-CASE TITLE
// REMOVEME: add as many use-cases as make sense

// optional section
== Conclusions

REPLACEME: Offer a conclusion

// optional section
== Resources

REPLACEME: Link to resorces like data sources, further discussions, 

// optional Footer
